# Codebridge test task

**Hi there!**

This is project for searching news.

## To run the project 
- `npm i` in the root
- `npm run dev` in the root
- Congrats! Now go to http://localhost:4000/

## More details about the project
- I used https://api.spaceflightnewsapi.net/v3 for news api
- Search results is saving among page change or app interactions. (i save query in URL search params)
- The description of the news articles is too short, so it looks a little bit ugly :(
